This was my very first assignment in web development and design.
We were given the choice between two fictional companies, and I chose to create a website for a restaurant. At the time, I was still learning the fundamentals, like when to use absolute positioning (and when not to), and I was just beginning to get the hang of Flexbox and Grid.

Despite that, I took full creative control - I designed everything from scratch including the logo, color palette, and overall visual identity. I also edited all images and videos to match the mood and ensure a consistent, polished look. My focus was on building a user-friendly layout, a welcoming design, and a cohesive experience from start to finish.

Looking back, Iâ€™m proud of how it turned out and how it reflects my early instincts for design and user experience.
