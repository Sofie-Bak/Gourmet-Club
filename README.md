**This was my very first assignment in web development and design.**
We were given the choice between two fictional companies, and I chose to create a website for a restaurant. At the time, I was still learning the fundamentals-like when to use absolute positioning (and when not to), and I was just beginning to understand how to use Flexbox and Grid effectively.

That said, I focused on crafting a user-friendly layout, a welcoming visual style, and a design that felt cohesive and intentional. Despite my technical inexperience at the time, Iâ€™m proud of how it turned out and how it reflects my eye for design and intuitive user experience.
